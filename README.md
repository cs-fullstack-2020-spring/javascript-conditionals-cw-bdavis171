#### Great job! Be sure to sprinkle some comments in your JS file to explain what certain lines are doing
#### Score : 5/5
### Problem 1 : CORRECT
Create two variables
```
let anyWord = [WORD]
let theSameWord = [WORD]
```
create an if statement comparing the two variables. If they are the same print
```
THAT IS...

```
Else print
```
THAT IS...
NOT CORRECT
```
### Problem 2 : CORRECT
Ask the user to enter a number. If the number is positive print 
```

```
Oherwise print
```
[NUMBER] is negative.
```
### Problem 3 : CORRECT
Ask the user to enter a number. Ask the user to enter another number. If the sum of those two numbers is even alert the user 
```

```
Oherwise alert the user
```
The sum of [FIRST NUMBER] and [SECOND NUMBER] is odd.
```
### Problem 4 : NOT GRADED (but you got it!)
Define a variable called `secretWord` with the string value "secret". Ask the user to enter a word. Ask the user to enter another word. If the words are the same OR one of the words matches `secretWord` print 
```
You got in...but we don't know how
```
If both words are the same but DO NOT match `secretWord` print
```
You got in...but only because your words matched
```
If only one of the words matched `secretWord` print
```
You got in..but only because one of your words matched the secret word
```
If both words are the same AND they match `secretWord` print
```
You got in!
```
Otherwise print
```
Locked Out
```
